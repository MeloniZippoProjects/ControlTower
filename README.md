# ControlTower

This group project was developed as part of the course Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems and Networks. Aim of the project was to study an airport system through analytical means (queueing theory) and simulations.

The use of simulations involved
- Modeling of the system, focused on the characteristics to simulate
- Coding of the simulation software using Omnetpp framework
- gawk scripting to convert the outputs to matlab .m files
- Matlab scripting to obtain graphs from the raw data
- PowerShell scripting to automate the configuration-simulation-conversion workflow
